    "lead, which runs parallel to the motor feed for most of its length and could pick "
    "up switching noise. A fabricator would still be able to cut and crimp from the "
    "tables alone, although the splice note is small. Next I would re-route the sense "
    "lead along the far edge of the bundle and re-render to confirm the separation. "
    "Overall the sheet communicates intent well, and the remaining risk sits in one "

    "enclosure through the lower grommet, which shortens the exposed run by a hand "

    "the route plan, so the kitting step should be quick. I am less sure about the "
    "strain relief at the grommet because the contract gives no bend radius for the "
    "jacket. Somebody assembling it would appreciate the clearer branch order, while "
    "the end user never sees any of it unless the lid is opened for service later."

    "is no longer the dominant risk I see here. The drawing gained a test-point table "
    "that production can use for continuity checks without a second document. My "

    "次の工程ではセンス線を束の反対側へ移し、再描画して分離が保たれているかを確認したい。"
    "全体としては設計意図が伝わる図面であり、誤読のリスクは注記の大きさに集中している。"
    "コネクタの嵌合方向は矢印で示されているが、裏面視か表面視かの明記が無いので追記したい。"
    "ケーブル長の基準点は嵌合面に揃っており、治具板への展開もそのまま行えると判断した。"
    "保守担当者が現地で断線を探す場面を想像すると、試験点の一覧が図面に同居している点は心強い。"
