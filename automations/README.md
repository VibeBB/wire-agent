# Automation templates

Ready-made automation requests for the plugin preset
(`POST /v1/preset/plugin` on the automation service, or the Automations
screen in Agent Canvas). Each file is a request body; copy it, adjust the
cron schedule and the workspace paths, and submit it. Automations run with
the plugin attached, so `wire` tools and hooks work exactly as in an
interactive conversation — including the deterministic gates.

- `reverify-weekly.automation.json` — re-runs the wire gates on a checked-in
  design every week and reports drift between the recorded verdict and a
  fresh run.

Keep `plugins` pointing at the released plugin path (`plugins/wire` on
`main`) unless you are testing a development branch. `model` names the LLM
profile for runs; leave it out to use the active profile. `repos` clones
the workspace repository that carries the design inputs.
